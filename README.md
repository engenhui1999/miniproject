# SHRO Face Recognition Project
This is a simple face recognition project for us during the SHRO period. Our goal is to create a
state of the art face recognition system, researching on the latest trends andbest practices. All
in the unit are welcome to join :)

## How to start:
The project runs on a 2 step process. The face detector focuses on detecting faces on a loop, while
the face recognition will only run when the button is pressed. Press the 'Get Info' to get the stored 
information about the person.  

To run the Face Detector:  
```
python face_detector.py
```
To run the Recognition App:  
```
python recognition.py
```
